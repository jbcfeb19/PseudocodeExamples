INPUTS
Length of roof in feet
Width of roof in feet
Number of inches of rainfall

OUTPUTS
Cubic inches of water
Number of gallons of rainfall

VARIABLES
length
width
in_rainfall
cu_in_water
gallons_water

PROCESSING STEPS
1. Prompt the user for the length and width of the roof in feet.
2. Calculate the cubic inches of water:

	cu_in_water = (length * 12) * (width * 12) * in_rainfall

3. Calculate the number of gallons of water:
	
	gallons_water = cu_in_water / 231

4. Print cu_in_water and gallons_water result to the screen.
